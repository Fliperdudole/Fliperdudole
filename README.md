Welcome to my page! I'm a humble starter who probably is making some huge mistakes on his programming!
- Most likely League of Legends oriented programming just cause I love that game wayyy too much
- Currently studying at MTSU for Comp Sci
- If for what ever reason you need to reach me, send an email to Flipthedudole@gmail.com
